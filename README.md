# Blocks randomizer

This is a simple GUI app to practice piano blocks for the
[Play Piano Fluently](https://playpianofluently.com/) course by Phil Best.
Mostly generated by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com).

I found the existing block randomizer inconvenient for practicing for these
reasons:
- it shuffles all the blocks at once while I only want to practice blocks I've
    learned so far
- it displays all the blocks at once making the page filled with many blocks,
    requires extra effort (and eye strain if your display is not close/large
    enough) to track current block
- allows you to see all the next blocks and think about their keyboard layout
- requires page refresh to generate a new random block sequence

This app works in a very simple way: you enter the
blocks you want to practice and the interval between block change, press the
`Start` button and the app will display a single, randomly chosen block in a
large output field. The size/font of the output field scales along with the main
window height so it's easy to adjust it for your eyes.
